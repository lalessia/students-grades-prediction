# High School Students' Grade Prediction

<p>This project analyzes and predicts the grades of high school students, utilizing advanced data science techniques to identify the key factors influencing academic performance. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive machine learning models, I uncovered valuable insights to improve educational interventions. Developed using various regression algorithms, the project highlights how factors such as family environment and alcohol consumption habits can significantly impact academic achievement. This work represents the final project of my Master's in Data Science at start2impact and reflects my commitment to fostering knowledge from a young age and supporting it with data

## Key Challenges
This project presented several significant challenges:

 - **Variable Encoding**: Properly encoding categorical variables was crucial to ensure that the data could be effectively utilized in the analysis. Choosing the right encoding techniques was essential to maintain the integrity of the data and avoid introducing biases.

 - **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most impactful features for data analysis was a critical step. It required careful consideration to ensure that only the variables with the highest predictive power were included, which directly influenced the accuracy of the analysis and predictions.

 - **Regression Algorithm Selection**: Choosing the most appropriate regression algorithms for predicting final grades was another major challenge. The selection process involved evaluating various models to find the best fit for the data, balancing complexity with predictive performance.
